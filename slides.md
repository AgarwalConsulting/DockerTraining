### Containers

---
class: center, middle

![Container Analogy](assets/images/container-analogy.png)

---

- Using `docker run`, to start a container

- Using `docker ps`, to view status of containers

- Using `docker stop`, to stop a container

- Using `docker rm`, to remove a stopped container

---
class: center, middle

#### Exercise: Run a linux container, create a file inside it and stop it

---
class: center, middle

Containers are *ephemeral*

---
class: center, middle

### Images

---

#### Key concepts

- Image is the definition of what a **container** is created from.

- Images are **immutable**. If you make changes, a new image must be built.

- Images are made of **layers**.

- Images are **inherited** from **base images** and can be many levels deep.

- `docker images`

.content-credits[https://www.vergeops.com/]

---

#### Creating an image

- From a [running container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/)...

  - `docker commit`

---
class: center, middle

or

---
class: center, middle

### Dockerfile

Or `dockerfile`, `my-dockerfile`, ...

---

- Use `Dockerfile`

  - *Infrastructure as Code*

  - All images are based on other images as their parent.

  - You must choose a parent, or `FROM` image.

  - `scratch` is the base empty image supplied by Docker.

  - Base images include all settings, files, what command runs at startup, etc.

- Create an image using

  - `docker build`

---

Here is the format of the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Comment
INSTRUCTION arguments
```

---

Eg. [`hello-world`'s `Dockerfile`](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world)

```bash
cat Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY hello /
CMD ["/hello"]
```

---

#### Other Commands

There are just a handful of simple `Instructions`:

```bash
FROM # which image this inherits from
LABEL # custom information
WORKDIR # Change to a directory until changed again.
  # Works like cd
USER # Change to a user
RUN # Run a Linux command in a new layer.
  # The command is dependent on which shell is in the image.
EXPOSE # Tells what ports this container will listen on.
  # Does not actually publish a port, but is rather like documentation.
ADD # copy files into the container
COPY # copy files into the container.
  # Similar to ADD
ENTRYPOINT # The command to be run when container is started.
  # This is inherited from a base image.
CMD # provides defaults to be run after the ENTRYPOINT.
  # Also inherited from the base image.
```

[More...](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

---

#### Layers

- Images are made of **layers**.

- Each instruction in a `Dockerfile` adds a layer. (*True* for older Docker installations)

- When pushing/pulling an image to a repository (more to come), only the **changed layers** are pushed to save bandwidth.

---
class: center, middle

Only the instructions *RUN, COPY, ADD* create layers.

.content-credits[https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/]

---

- Other instructions create temporary intermediate images, and do not increase the size of the build.

- When building an image, Docker steps through the instructions in your Dockerfile, executing each in the order specified.

- As each instruction is examined, Docker looks for an existing image in its cache that it can reuse, rather than creating a new (duplicate) image.

.image-credits[https://www.vergeops.com/]

---

#### Image Tags

- You can uniquely identify an image using a tag name

- `docker build -t <image-name>:<tag-name> .`

- `latest` is the default tag name

---
class: center, middle

#### Exercise: Create a `hello-world` image, similar to [`hello-haskell`](https://github.com/AgarwalConsulting/DockerTraining/tree/master/examples/0-hello-world/hello-haskell)

### Registry

---

- Many options: Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP Container Registry, ...

- Default: https://hub.docker.com/

- Private repository...

---

#### Pulling from a repository

`docker pull hello-world`

---

#### Pushing to a repository

`docker push <image-name>:<tag-name>`

---
class: center, middle

#### Exercise: [Push the `hello-world` image to hub](https://github.com/AgarwalConsulting/DockerTraining/blob/master/challenges/pushing-to-remote-repo.md), ask a participant to run it on their system

`docker run --network` (or) `docker run --link`

---
class: center, middle

Docker uses the `Container Network Model` specification.

---
class: center, middle

*libnetwork* aims to satisfy that composable need for Networking in Containers.

The goal of *libnetwork* is to deliver a robust *Container Network Model* that provides a consistent programming interface and the required network abstractions for applications.

#### What happens when I run a container and expose a port?

---
class: center, middle

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

---

#### Linux Network Namespaces

Network namespaces is a part of containerization technology that is used by the Linux kernel to provide isolation between containers.

It allows, for example, a container to have its own network stack, its own networking configuration, and its own routing configuration.

---

- The tool that is used to operate with `network ns`: `iproute2`

- Network namespaces are stored in `/var/run/netns`

- There are two types of network namespaces:

  - Root namespace `ip link`
  - Non-root namespace `ip netns .. ip link`

Default docker networking mode: Bridge mode

---
class: center, middle

A `Linux bridge` is a virtual implementation of a physical switch inside of the Linux kernel.

It forwards packets between interfaces that are connected to it. It's usually used for forwarding packets on routers, on gateways, or between VMs and *network namespaces* on a host.

It forwards traffic basing itself on MAC addresses, which are in turn discovered dynamically by inspecting traffic.

---
class: center, middle

```bash
bridge add <container-id> /var/run/netns/<namespace>
```
