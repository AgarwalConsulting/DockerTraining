# Networking & Inspection Hands-on

* Use `gauravagarwalr/spring-greeting` for this hands-on
* Figure out the port in which the service is running
* After starting the container,
  * Start another container using `alpine` or `ubuntu` & make a curl request to the service running inside
  * Don't expose the port to the host machine
