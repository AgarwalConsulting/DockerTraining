# RV Store

The RV Store is a made-up e-commerce application.

> Because your friendly instructor lives in an RV full-time and travels the country exploring, this is an obvious choice! It is completely contrived and shallow but shows how several Docker images can be put together to build a real microservice application.

## Instructions

Please refer the `RV Store Docker Lab.pdf` in the same directory.
